# Secure Cloud Storage App

This repository contains the source code for a cloud storage application with a front-end implemented in HTML/CSS/JS, a PHP back-end following the MVC pattern, MariaDB for the database, and Nginx acting as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

## Features

- **Front-end:** The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless experience for interacting with the secure cloud storage service.

- **Back-end (PHP MVC):** The PHP back-end follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, enhancing code organization and maintainability. Key components include routers, controllers, models, and views.

- **Database (MariaDB):** MariaDB is used as the database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- **Docker Containers:**
    - The application components (Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP) are each running in separate Docker containers for ease of deployment and scalability.
